# arts second week

## R 

This week, let's learn some basic syntax about go!

First of all, we'll talk about variable of go.

Variable is a pointer (or a name) given to a memory location. You can define a variable just like below.

```go
var age int
```
``int`` means that age is an integer variable.or you can omit the type word if you initial the variable like below.
```go
var age = 15
```
go will know that age is type of int, the other way to define a variable is:

```go
age := 15
```

This way, you can declare and initial variable by only on line.

Multiple variable declaration: you can declare multiple variable.
```go
var age, height int

var h, w = 100, 50

var(
    age int
    x = 1
    str = "string"
)

name, z := "string", 30
```

# A

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        if(head.next == null) return null;
        ListNode p = head;
        ListNode flag = head;
        for(; n>0; n--){
            p = p.next;
        }
        if(p == null) return head.next;
        while(p.next != null){
            p = p.next;
            flag = flag.next;
        }

        flag.next = flag.next.next;
        return head;
    }
}
```

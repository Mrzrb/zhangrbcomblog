# arts second week

## R 

This week, let's learn some basic syntax about go!

First of all, we'll talk about variable of go.

Variable is a pointer (or a name) given to a memory location. You can define a variable just like below.

```go
var age int
```
``int`` means that age is an integer variable.or you can omit the type word if you initial the variable like below.
```go
var age = 15
```
go will know that age is type of int, the other way to define a variable is:

```go
age := 15
```

This way, you can declare and initial variable by only on line.

Multiple variable declaration: you can declare multiple variable.
```go
var age, height int

var h, w = 100, 50

var(
    age int
    x = 1
    str = "string"
)

name, z := "string", 30
```
